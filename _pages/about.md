I am a **Research Scientist** at [**Meta**](https://about.facebook.com/meta){:target="\_blank"} (formerly known as **Facebook**). Before joining Meta, I was a post-doctoral fellow at [**York University**](https://www.yorku.ca){:target="\_blank"} supervised by Prof. [**Michael S. Brown**](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~mbrown){:target="\_blank"}. I obtained my Ph.D degree in **Computer Science** at [**Yonsei University**](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr){:target="\_blank"} under the supervision of Prof. [**Seon Joo Kim**](https://sites.google.com/site/seonjookim){:target="\_blank"}. My research interests focus on **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning**. Particularly, I am interested in computational photography, deep generative models, and learning visual data with minimal supervision to improve technologies in digital photography.
